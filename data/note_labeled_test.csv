therapy for his severe respiratory disease during the treatment of his pneumonia he developed what was initially was thought to be a colonic obstruction this was evaluated at the referring hospital by the surgical and gastroenterology services and was found to be a colonic pseudo obstruction thought to be related to his pneumonia the patient failed to make significant progress in terms of his colonic pseudo obstruction the family request transfer to the hospital1 for further care he was initially transferred to the medical service for management of his pneumonia and colonic pseudo obstruction gastroenterology and surgical services were consulted both services concurred with nonoperative management of his process and treating the underlying illness with correction of any electrolyte abnormalities and minimization of any narcotics anticholinergic agents which may exacerbate the pseudo obstruction the patient was transferred on his symptoms actually resolved on the day of transfer with resumption of bowel function and passage of gas this was visible on his plain radiograph imaging he did not require any intervention for this he was passing gas and having loose stools first several days but then began to develop some increasing abdominal distention on this was thought to be possible recurrence of his pseudo obstruction and again managed conservatively over the course of the ensuing days the patient was found to have free intraperitoneal air on an abdominal x ray from and as the patient did not initially manifest systemic signs of sepsis given as co morbidities he was managed non operatively with antibiotics his disease progressed and he became progressively more ill and was taken emergently to the operating room on extensive discussions were undertaken with the family and the patient highlighting the high risk of the surgery given his extensive co morbidities and the high risk about morbidity and mortality they understood and wished to pursue all treatment on he underwent an extended right colectomy with an end ileostomy please see the operative note for further details his postoperative course was initially marked by prolonged ventilator dependence and acute on chronic renal insufficiency his malnutrition and his immunosuppression from steroids hampered his initial recovery he did develop some degree of pneumonia and pleural effusions and given the high likelihood that he would require mechanical ventilation for some period of time tracheostomy was placed on he continued to require full ventilatory nutritional support as well as antibiotic therapy for his pneumonia nutritional support was provided with combination of initially tpn and subsequently enteral feedings on he began to have increasing drainage from his abdominal incision this was opened at the bedside and evidenced a fascial dehiscence he was taken to emergently back to the operating room for fascial closure notably at this time there was no evidence of healing taking place since the time of operation days prior highlighting his severe degree of immunosuppression and malnutrition he was subsequently maintained in the icu with the narcotics for pain control and sedation full ventilatory support was required he failed multiple attempts at weaning despite aggressive pulmonary toilet and attempts at diuresis his hemodynamics were relatively stable with occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation but otherwise no significant hemodynamic instability his ileostomy continued to function and never evidenced any ischemia his renal function continued to deteriorate somewhat with acute on chronic renal failure developing most concerning was the development of fungal infections in the sputum and urine over the course of the ensuing week the patient failed to progress despite maximal medical therapy and nutritional support discussions were had with the family to decide goals of care with the patient after several meetings the family made the decision to make the patient comfort measures only as he was in multisystem organ failure with progressively worsening infections and with a very low likelihood of any meaningful recovery the patient was made cmo on he was maintained on ventilatory support per the family s request his sedative medications and pain medications were continued over the course of the ensuing days
